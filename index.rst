Welcome to SIM-Cloud
========================

`Read the Docs`_ hosts documentation for the open source community.
We support Sphinx_ docs written with reStructuredText_ and `CommonMark`_.
We pull your code from your Subversion_, Bazaar_, Git_, and Mercurial_ repositories.
Then we build documentation and host it for you.
Think of it as *Continuous Documentation*.

The code is open source, and `available on GitHub`_.

The main documentation for the site is organized into a couple sections:

* :ref:`about-docs`
* :ref:`bestpractice-docs`
* :ref:`troubleshooting-docs`
* :ref:`services-docs`
* :ref:`api-docs`
* :ref:`limitations-docs`
